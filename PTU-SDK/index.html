                <h1 id="ptu-sdk">PTU-SDK</h1>
<p>PTU-SDK is an SDK provided by FLIR -- with additional utilities/wrappers written by DRIFT -- necessary to control the gimbal. </p>
<p>In this documentation, we outline the PTU-SDK works and how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="project-stack">Project Stack</h2>
<p>This project is written in the <code>C++17</code> standard,
and utilizes the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>FLiR Base PTU-SDK - The base sdk as provided by FLiR, which facilitates low-level communication with the gimbal<ul>
<li>FLiR Cerial Library - A networking library used by the base sdk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>PyBind11 - A library for easily creating python bindings for C++</li>
<li>Python Setuptools - A python build system for creating python modules from this project</li>
<li>CMake - Building all components of the sdk</li>
<li>clang-tidy - Checks and linting to ensure code quality</li>
<li>clang-format - Formatting rules for the project</li>
<li>gcc/clang - Either compiler can be utilized depending on developer preference</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these components, CMake, gcc/clang, and Python are REQUIRED for building this project!
The rest are either provided with the project, or are optional.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>This section describes the outline of the project,
which includes the physical layout of the project files,
CMake build targets, and how components in this project interact.</p>
<h3 id="file-structure">File Structure</h3>
<p>This project has the following outline:</p>
<pre><code>PTU-SDK/
├── build
├── dist
├── docs
├── include
│   └── dptu
├── libs
│   └── ptu-sdk
│       └── cerial
├── python
│   └── pdptu
├── src
└── utils
    ├── drift
    └── sdk-examples
</code></pre>
<p>Some of these directories will NOT be included in version control,
so they may not be present in a fresh clone.
All these directories will be auto-generated in one way or another
if you preform the operations outlined in the documentation.
Directories not included in version control are:</p>
<ul>
<li>build - CMake generated build files, your final build binaries will be placed here when building with CMake!</li>
<li>dist - Final Python source distributions / wheels that are built via setuptools</li>
</ul>
<p>The other directories are described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>docs - Contains documentation for this project</li>
<li>include - Header files for custom libraries created for this project<ul>
<li>dptu - header files for the drift PTU sdk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>src - Source files for custom libraries created for this project</li>
<li>python - Python bindings for the drift PTU sdk</li>
<li>utils - Development/testing utilities to simplify certain gimbal operations<ul>
<li>drift - Utilities produced by drift</li>
<li>sdk-examples - Utilities provided with the base sdk, these are unaltered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>libs - External libraries vendored with this project. Required for building any project components<ul>
<li>ptu-sdk - The provided base sdk, mostly unaltered<ul>
<li>cerial - 'Cerial' library utilized by the base sdk, mostly unaltered</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The directories to keep in mind are <code>include/</code>, <code>src/</code>, and <code>utils/drift</code>.
All others are either automatically generated or are not meant to be changed,
as we are striving to keep the provided base components static as much as possible.
Any new components and alterations can be be done in the three directories specified most of the time!</p>
<h3 id="cmake-structure">CMake Structure</h3>
<p>This project uses CMake in all build scenarios!
All components in this project are CMake enabled,
allowing most operations to be done via CMake.
This project defines many targets that can be built,
but most of the time you only want to focus on a few
Below is a outline of the targets, children of a target depends on them:</p>
<pre><code>cerial
└── ptusdk
    ├── dptu
    │   ├── driftutil
    │   └── pdptu
    └── sdkexamples
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>cerial - Networking library required by the base sdk</li>
<li>ptusdk - Provided base sdk library</li>
<li>sdkexamples - Builds ALL provided base sdk example binaries, can be executed</li>
<li>dptu - DRIFT wrapper library around the base sdk</li>
<li>driftutil - Builds ALL DRIFT utility binaries, can be executed</li>
<li>pdptu - Python bindings for dptu as a shared library. Building this yourself is usually not required, see the python section</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cmake">CMake</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier in this document, this project is build via <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>.
It is recommended to handle this process through your IDE,
but it is possible to do so manually.</p>
<p>Build Steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a build directory: <code>mkdir build</code></li>
<li>Navigate to build directory: <code>cd build/</code></li>
<li>Invoke CMake to configure the project: <code>cmake ..</code></li>
</ol>
<p>After the project has been configured, you will see the <code>build</code>
directory has been populated with many files!
Pretty much all of these can be ignored, but later down the line
we will outline some files that are relevant.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build your target: <code>make [TARGET]</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Where <code>[TARGET]</code> is the name of the target you wish to build.
You can see a list of targets above in the CMake Structure section.
For example, if you wish to build the <code>dptu</code> target:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">make dptu
</code></pre>
<p>Any dependencies will be automatically built for you,
so don't worry about building any parents.</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate your build</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are building a library, it will be in format <code>.a</code> for a static library,
or <code>.so</code> for a shared library. Unless you are building the python bindings,
all libraries built by this project are static, and will have filetype <code>.a</code>.</p>
<p>Executables have varying filetypes. On Unix like systems,
they will not have a file extension.
On Windows, they will have a <code>.exe</code> extension.</p>
<p>CMake organizes the <code>build</code> directory in the same way the project is structured.
This means it places binaries in locations that are comparable to that of the project.
For example, if you build the <code>demo</code> executable,
you can find it in:</p>
<pre><code>build/utils/drift/demo
</code></pre>
<p>The same goes for other components, simply follow the directories to locate your binary.
Once you have located your binary, you can move it to wherever you like!
From there, you can utilize it as you see fit.</p>
<p>If you experience any strange errors,
or mess up the state of the build system,
then you can safely delete the build directory and restart.
The build directory does not contain any valuable information!
So deleting and reconfiguring has no large consequences,
other than the time that is required to re-create and re-build any components.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>This project also contains Python bindings that allow
this code to be worked with and utilized in Python!
This is done via <a href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11">PyBind11</a>,
which greatly simplifies this procedure.
PyBind11 is automatically fetched by CMake at configure time,
so it is not necessary to install this dependency system wide!
Here are the steps to build the python module:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, create a python virtual environment: <code>python -m venv venv/</code></li>
<li>Activate the virtual environment: <code>source venv/bin/activate</code></li>
<li>Next, install build tools: <code>pip install build</code></li>
<li>Invoke the build system: <code>python -m build</code></li>
</ol>
<p>From here, it will build your python module and place it into the <code>dist/</code> directory.
This command will create two types of distributions, which we will cover below.</p>
<h3 id="source-distribution">Source Distribution</h3>
<p>A source distribution is a Python package that contains
the files necessary to build your Python module.
When asked to install this package,
Python will use the contents to build the module for the system it is running on.
This is the recommended way to distribute the Python module!
It is best to have other developers build the module from scratch on their own systems,
instead of having to worry about platform differences and cross-compilation.</p>
<p>The downside to this approach is that source distributions require extra time
to install on the end of the receiver, as they will need to build the module themselves.
This will also require the receiver to have build tools installed,
such as CMake and a compiler (gcc/clang), which may be trivial or very difficult
to install depending on your platform.</p>
<p>Source distributions have extension of type <code>.tar.gz</code></p>
<h3 id="wheel-distribution">Wheel Distribution</h3>
<p>A so-called 'wheel' is a type of Python package that contains a pre-built module.
Wheels are very useful as they do not require a build operation before installing,
so any receivers of the wheel can utilize the package immediately and do not require any build tools to be installed.</p>
<p>The downside is that the wheel can only be used on the platform it was built on.
For example, if a wheel is built on Linux, it is only possible
to install and use the wheel on Linux platforms.
A windows user could not use such a wheel.
While it is possible to cross-build wheels for other platforms,
it is not recommended to do so as this introduces a lot of complexity.
So, you probably will not be distributing the wheel to others.</p>
<p>Wheel distributions have extension of type <code>.whl</code></p>
<h2 id="development-environment">Development Environment</h2>
<p>Developers may work on the project using any tools they like!
It is possible to work with this project with nothing more than a text editor,
given that you have the requirements satisfied in the tech stack portion of this document.
However, this is not recommended, so we will provide a minimum development environment recommendation</p>
<p>VSCode is the recommended IDE for this project!
It is highly configurable and offers all the features you could want.
Any IDE that has support for C++ and CMake would suffice (such as CLion),
but we will focus on VSCode in this section.</p>
<p>Alongside VSCode, you will want the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools">C/C++</a> - Enables C/C++ Development in VSCode</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools">CMake Tools</a> - Adds support for CMake enabled projects</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cschlosser.doxdocgen">Doxygen Generator</a> - Simplifies the process of creating doxygen documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>These extensions are the bare minimum, and it is recommended to install other extensions
that enhance your workflow, such as the GitHub integration extension.</p>
<p>Alongside these extensions, we suggest the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>C_Cpp.codeAnalysis.clangTidy.enabled = true</code> - Enables clang-tidy checks to be preformed by VSCode</li>
<li><code>C_Cpp.codeAnalysis.clangTidy.useBuildPath = true</code> - Instructs clang-tidy to utilize CMake <code>compile-commands.json</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This will allow VSCode to build and analyze this project for you!</p>
<h2 id="code-components">Code Components</h2>
<p>This section will describe the files that make up this project.
Most of the code is already documented in the source!
All functions/components have docstrings that describe their usage and behavior,
and all code is well commented.
However, this section will offer a high level view of the codebase.</p>
<p>This project uses the conventional C++ project format,
a collection of header files that each have a source file.
The header files each contain components that do a specific thing.
We will go over each file and go over the broad details:</p>
<pre><code>include/
└── dptu
    ├── comwrap.hpp
    ├── entry.hpp
    ├── init.hpp
    └── trans.hpp
</code></pre>
<h3 id="init">init</h3>
<p>The <code>init.hpp</code> header contains components for creating and destroying a 'harness',
which is a structure that contains the necessary information for communicating with the gimbal.
The nature of this structure will not be discussed here
(you may look into the base SDK code if you are curious),
as it is not important for gimbal usage.</p>
<p>The creation process, done via <code>init_harness()</code> will allocate
and configure the harness for operation.
The destruction process, done via <code>close_harness()</code> will
close the harness and free any memory.</p>
<p>It is REQUIRED for all operations to use these methods
for creating and destroying the harness!
Failing to do either operations can cause bugs and trouble!
Most features the DRIFT wrapper provides are optional and can be ignored,
but this operation is required!</p>
<h3 id="comwrap">comwrap</h3>
<p>The <code>comwrap.hpp</code> header contains components for wrapping certain SDK operations.
The procedure for sending a command to the gimbal via the base sdk
is somewhat complicated and weird.
So, one of the major goals of this project is to simplify operations
and this header defines components that do just that.</p>
<p>Most of the functions in this header are simple and self explanatory,
such as <code>ptu_go_to()</code>, that sends the gimbal to the provided position.
All of these functions are documented in source, so we will not cover most of these.</p>
<p>However, there are two functions that simplify certain operations.
First, <code>prep_start()</code> will prepare the gimbal for operation.
When booting, the gimbal may be in an undesirable state.
For example, the axis speed will be zero positions per second,
so any move commands will do nothing.
This function sets the gimbal to a standard state that will prepare the gimbal for operation.
Ideally, this should be executed before any other unit commands.</p>
<p>The <code>prep_stop()</code> function does the opposite,
it prepares the unit for shutdown.
This ensures the gimbal will be in a safe state,
and will not move out of this position before the gimbal is powered off.
Ideally, this should be the last gimbal operation you preform before shutdown,
as any commands issued after this one will not be acknowledged.
If you have stopped the gimbal, you may start it again by using the <code>prep_start()</code> method,
which will place the gimbal into the initial start state, allowing the gimbal to respond to commands once more.</p>
<h3 id="entry">entry</h3>
<p>The <code>entry.hpp</code> header contains easy to use entry points into the project.
It consists of a class, <code>PTUPoint</code>, that will handle starting, stopping,
translating, and pointing at certain positions.
This class is primarily used in the python wrappers,
as it greatly simplifies the binding operation.</p>
<h3 id="trans">trans</h3>
<p>The <code>trans.hpp</code> header contains components for translating positions into gimbal rotations in both axis.
We are given positions in North, East, Up coordinates,
which are the distance in meters from the origin point in each respective axis.
In all cases, we assume the gimbal is the origin of the system.</p>
<p>These functions translate these positions into rotations that the gimbal can work with.
The details of these functions can be found in the docstrings and the source.
You can see <code>entry.cpp</code> for an example of how to use these components.</p>
