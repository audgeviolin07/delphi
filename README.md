# delphi
Documentation for relevant repositories to LEADS.

## Notes for Developers
Do NOT directly edit the files within `docs`. `delphi` is scheduled every 24 hours to `cURL` all documentation files from the relevant repositories. 

If you'd like to immediately manually update `delphi` _after_ editing the documentation of the repository you're working on:
* Actions -> Update Documentation -> Run workflow
